//let FiveDString = "This one is a little more complicated"

//6) Write a function that returns the number of unique Ints in an array of Ints
//Sample input:
//let inputArray = [3,1,4,1,3,2,6,1,9]

//Sample output:
//4


//Explanation:
//2, 4, 6, 9 are unique in the array.  Every other number is not unique.

//7) Write a function that converts a binary number into decimal.  The binary number will be given as an array of Ints.

//Sample input:
//let binaryArray = [1,0,1,1,1,0,1]

//Sample output:
//93

//8) Copy the movie dictionary from homework two and add another [String] to each movie.
//   Name it "locations" and add some dummy data. Use the re-factored nested function
//   from the full lesson (we didn't go over it) to print both the cast list and the 
//   locations.

//Write your code below


//9) Given one movie write a function that takes the movie (remember to use its type)
//   as its only argument and return a tuple that contains name, year and genre.

//Write your code below


//10) Define a function that takes the movie array that will call the function you just created 
//    in answer to the previous question. The new function should return an array of the
//    tuples: (name, year, genre).

//Write your code below


//11) Write a function that takes the movie as its only argument that lists all cast members across movies.
//    The tricky part: no duplicates. I think you'll need to edit the data to create some doubled actors in order
//    to test this. Return should be [String]?.

//Write your code below
