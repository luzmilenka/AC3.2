## A) For each prompt below, write a for loop that prints out the specified information.

1) All the numbers from 1 to 150 inclusive 


for i in 1...150 {
print(i)
}


2) All the numbers from 142 to 159 exclusive

for i in 142..<159 {
print(i)
}


3) Only the even numbers from 15 to 80 inclusive

for i in 15...80 {
if i % 2 == 0 {
print(i)
}
}

4) Only the odd numbers from 19 to 51 inclusive

for i in 19...51 {
if i % 3 == 0 {
print(i)
}
}


5) All the numbers that end in a 5 from 1 to 100 exclusive

for i in 1..<100 {
if i % 10 == 5 {
print(i)
}
}


6) All the numbers that end in a 7 from 1 to 40 inclusive

for i in 1...40 {
if i % 10 == 7 {
print(i)
}
}



## B) Given a range of numbers from 20 to 150 print out all the numbers that follows these conditions

1) Numbers that are divisible by 3

2) Numbers that are divisible by 2 and 3

3) Unit digit ends with 4

4) Print out numbers contain 31, 35, 40 to 60.


for i in 20...151 {
if i % 3 == 0 {
print(i)
}
else if i % 2 == 0 && i % 3 == 0 {
print (i)
}
else if 1 % 10 == 4 {
print (i)
}
else if i % 10 == 31 || i % 10 == 35 || (i >= 40 && i <= 60) {
print(i)
}

}

## C) While loop (NO Xcode)
```
var i = 5
while (i > 3) {
  i += 1
}
```
1) How many times does this while loop execute? Infinitive

2) How do you stop the loop when i reaches 9?

var i = 4
while (i > 3) {
   if i == 9 {
      break
   }
   i += 1
}
print(i)




3) How would you fix the while loop so that it only execute 1,000 times.

4) Once the loop can run 1,000 times, print out ONLY the event number.




```
var i = 1
while i <= 10 {
print("i = \(i)")
i+=
}
```
```
var i = 1
do {
print("i = \(i)")
i+=
}while i <= 10
```
5) What's the difference between these two while loop?

6) If there's a difference, how would you fix it so that both outputs are the same.


## D) Short Answer Questions (NO Xcode)

1) What's the difference between break vs continue?

2) Without using Xcode explain the result of the following for-in loops.
* a)
```
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >=4 && i <= 7){
        continue
    }
    print(i)
}
```
* b)
```
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >=4 && i <= 7){
        break
    }
    print(i)
}
```
* Bonus)
```
outerloop: for x in 1...3 {
    innerloop: for y in 1...3 {
        if y == 2{
            continue outerloop
        }
        print("x = \(x), y = \(y)")
    }
}
```
##E) Nested loops
1) Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) where x and y are both integers.

2) Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) where x and y are both even numbers.

3) Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) where the difference of x and y is at least 5, and x and y are both integers.

4) Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) where the product of x and y is less than 6, and x and y are both integers.

5) Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) where the x is not equal to y and x and y are both integers.
