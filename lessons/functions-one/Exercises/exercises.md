# Functions

#### Question 1.
Complete the function so that it will print out total cost after tax.
Make sure to call the function afterwards
```swift
let itemCost = 45.0
let nyTax = 0.08775

func totalWithTax() {

}

```

### Question 2.
Motify Q1's function with return type of Int and use external name to look more legible.
Function calls should look something like "total cost of the item after tax"







### Question 3.
Convert the the following if/else statement below into function with a String return type.

```swift
todaysTemperature = 72

if todaysTemperature <= 40 {
    print("It's cold out.")
} else if todaysTemperature >= 85 {
    print("It's really warm.")
} else {
    print("Weather is moderate.")
}
```


### Question 4.
Write a function that takes in any two positive integers and return the sum.








### Question 5.
Write a function takes in any number grade and returns a letter grade

* 100 -> A+
* 90 - 99 -> A
* 80 - 89 -> B
* 70 - 79 -> C
* 65 - 69 -> D
* Below 65 -> F




### Bonus.
Make a calculator function that takes in three parameters (two numbers and one operator).
Operater parameter: (+, -, x, /)
